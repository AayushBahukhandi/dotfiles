Pulumi vs Other IaC
	 Tools like Terraform and Aws Cloud Formation uses Domain specific language like HCL ,json,yaml
	 - New language to learn
	 - Inflexible (conditionals ,loops)

 With pulumi most of traditional language supported
 like js,ts,java,golang,python (we can use our IDE,
 access to all 3rd party libraries,tooling & ecosystem linting formatting,testing,CI/CD pipeline)
